		<center><p>Henry looks carefully into the telescope which lets him see far, far away, as far away as the distant nebulae on the far<br> edges of the Milky Way. Henry is an astronomer. He looks at the sky, and at stars in particular. Even though he spends much of <br>his time looking at detailed computer reports, which are just lists and lists of numbers, his favourite thing about his job is<br> looking through the telescope. And today he is very excited. He isnâ€™t sure yet, but he thinks he has seen a dense cloud which <br>might be the beginning of a new star.</p></center>
